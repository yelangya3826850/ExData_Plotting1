 Note
======

 * There are some little differences between my plots and the plots requested, that is the x-lab of the plots 2,3 and 4 are
   noted by the Chinese characters that you may do not understand. In fact, I installed the chinese version of R project as
   well as some pacages. So although I use the right packages there are still some variences that I cannot deal with. 
   
   the meaning of the Chinese characters:
   "周四" := Thu.  "周五" := Fri.  "周六" := Sat.
